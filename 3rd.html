<h1><i>Paragraphs & Topic Sentences</i></h1>
    <p>A paragraph is a <strong>series of sentences</strong> that are <em>organized and coherent</em>, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
    
    <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a <small>single long illustration of a general point.</small> It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
